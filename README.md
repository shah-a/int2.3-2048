## Description

This project follows a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOVEe9eawXc) from WebDevSimplified to make a clone of the popular game 2048.

This implementation of the game is modelled after this webapp: https://2048daily.com/

## How to Play

Mobile/touch-screen devices are supported.

## Future to-do

Some features that can be added to improve the app:

- Add a customization panel where player can change tile colour theme
- Option to pick which tiles to start the gameboard with
- Small percentage to randomly start the game with a large tile
- Check if user prefers reduced motion; remove some animations in that case
